            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>TikTok has changed the game for social media. It is a platform much like Instagram but JUST videos. Many people believe TikTok is brand new, but in actual fact it’s been around for much longer. TikTok actually was once a well known app “Musical.ly” but changed its name to TikTok in August 2018. The brand owner of Musical.ly decided it would be better to merge its community with those of TikTok to gain a better recognition within the industry. The decision was certainly a good one as now TikTok is worth over a whopping 80 BILLION. TikTok is fastly becoming one of the most used APPS on the app store. One of the main reasons is because of its analytics. A user may go onto instagram and receive maybe 4/5k views on their work, but on TikTok, their work is reaching numbers by the millions.</p>

            <h3>Cautions and Warnings</h3>

            <p>One of the main problematics or challenges about the app tik tok is likes. This creates a competitive environment where each person has to create a better video or have more likes and this can turn the app from being a great entertainment and learning space to a very negative and competitive space very quickly. In our generation today its all about success and whoever has better this or that and with tik toc viewers and creators see a video or “trend” doing well going viral and they tend to jump on the bandwagon, this can be a major challenge as a lot of the time the challenge or video trending could be harmful and through a platform so big as tik tok with everyone doing it , it can be almost promoted for example in 2018 there was the “tide pods” challenge in which young children and teens would take clothing washing pods and put them in there mouth and bite them, this is obviously extremely dangerous but through the use of an app like tik tok it began to be a trend that was “cool” so this is definitely a main challenge within this app.</p>
            <p>Privacy and security issues-
                <br> In january 2020 there was a security issue found in the app tik tok. According to an article write by A Cybersecurity firm CheckPoint were to have found flaws that could allow hackers to take control of TikTok accounts and manipulate the content, they could upload and delete videos and reveal personal information such as a private email address. The cybersecurity firm said “ it’s possible to send a standard text message to any phone number on behalf of TikTok. On the app’s own site, there is a function that lets users send a text message to themselves so they can download the app.But attackers could create a fake text message that appeared to be from TikTok, but actually contained a malicious link. Once users clicked on the link, hackers could take control of the account.” This being true causes a major security issue in the app.</p>

            <h3>TEACHING AND LEARNING</h3>

            <p>Using social media for education is a big thing today. Even things like moodle for college work would be fairly recent. There are other platforms such as Slack and Kahoot to also aid the learning process. Depending on the subject of learning, popular apps like Instagram and Twitter can also be used educationally. Using specific hashtags on these apps is a great way to keep up to date with work being done by the particular group. TikTok can also use hashtags to specify what videos are for teaching/learning. TikTok is a Chinese video sharing platform made in 2012. It was available globally in 2017. Since then, TikTok has developed many different uses, some of them involving teaching and learning. Before even thinking about anything academic, TikTok has been a place where you could learn something new. These include the popular video topic “life hacks”. This is where a user explains a trick to use in everyday life to make a certain task or chore a little more manageable. Other things you could learn from Tik Tok also include cooking, fitness tips, and even how to do the most popular dance trends. The most obvious example of TikTok being used for education however, is when the #EduTok programme was launched. This is a form of eLearning where users can post videos to teach others about various different topics, ranging from fitness workouts to solving mathematical equations. As of its launch, the genre of videos has received over 48 billion views on the app.</p>
