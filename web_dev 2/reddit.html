            <h3> Introduction</h3>

            <p>Reddit is a social media platform that allows people to sign up and create their own personal account, be able to vote and comment on other users uploads to the site. To help regulate the social media platform and prevent spammers from annoying daily Reddit users, they came up with “Karma” points. Users get karma points by their comments and posts, the more “up-votes” (also known as likes on other sites) they get, the more karma points they will earn. Reddit is a place for everything on the internet and its where the best content is posted. If you are interested in anything there is a place on Reddit for it. On this platform, you can make your own page about a certain topic. This is called a “Sub-reddit”. As an example, if you were interested in Web Development, you could join the “r/webdev” sub-reddit, and tons of people share stuff from their successful website skills to their problems that they cant fix and they need other peoples help. In this sub-reddit there is 500k members so there is plenty of people to help someone that is confused </p>

            <h3>CAUTIONS AND WARNINGS</h3>

            <p>With any Social Media application there are multiple safety aspects to it to protect people online from bullying or harassment and racism online. Of course, social media apps don’t allow you to be a troll online and there are multiple ways in which they can be stopped. Some challenges people might face is the fact that reddit can be quite brutal with its trolls because of the amount of freedom they have, and it is an application to let people have their own opinions. Although there is a block and report button there this isn’t stopping people from making new accounts and trolling people over and over.</p>

            <p>Reddit does have an age restriction of 13 years, so that means anyone under that age cannot sign up to Reddit But when you sign up to reddit it doesn’t ask you for your date of birth or anything, so this means anyone is free to sign up to reddit and do what they please, this leading to multiple accounts just there for trolling. As soon as someone posts a query or literally anything on reddit there could be many people that disagree with it and will throw abuse towards that person, and the worst-case scenario is that the person gets their account removed from reddit. For privacy and safety, you can change a number of different things in this tab for instance. You can set what you want to see on your reddit search bar etc. This making it better for the user to see what he/she wants to see.</p>

            <h3>TEACHING AND LEARNING</h3>

            <p>Although Reddit may not be the go-to for Learning and Teaching in a classroom bases, it could work. Social Media now a days is a major part in our society. It connects on another to discuss share and collaborate our ideas and criticisms. The way it could be used for Teaching and Learning in a classroom environment or even to expand your general knowledge on a subject is growing each year, such as it can make it easier to share class materials, can influence discussion on certain topics, and make working together easier than it ever has been before.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>The first way it could be used is when a teacher creates a reddit page for his/her students, to inform them with various assignments that may be given in that class and the same with homework. This works because the students can comment on any quires about the work that has been given and the teacher can give feedback.</li>
                <li>The second way it could be used is for discussions on various topics that might have been discussed in class, during that teaching. Students can communicate with one another in the comments section expressing their opinions on whatever topic.</li>
                <li>The third way it could be used for learning purposes is, people can post about various events that may be occurring globally, for instance the corona virus. It has been trending worldwide and people are uncertain about how they should react to it. On reddit people can give their opinions on it, quite like Twitter.</li>
